            <p>
                Manta rays are large, graceful marine animals belonging to the genus Mobula. Known for their impressive
                wingspans—some reaching up to 7 meters (23 feet)—they are among the largest rays in the ocean. Despite
                their size, manta rays are harmless filter feeders, feeding mainly on plankton and small fish by
                swimming with their mouths open.
            <ul>
                <li>There are two main species:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reef manta ray (Mobula alfredi) usually found in coastal waters near coral reefs.</li>
                    <li>Giant oceanic manta ray (Mobula birostris) often found in open oceans and capable of migrating
                        long distances.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Key Features:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Distinctive "wings" (pectoral fins) used to gracefully glide through the water.

                        Cephalic lobes, which help funnel plankton into their mouths.

                        High intelligence, with one of the largest brain-to-body ratios of any fish.

                        Known to exhibit behaviors such as curiosity, social interaction, and even self-recognition (a
                        sign of complex cognition). add this to introduction part and make the introduction part
